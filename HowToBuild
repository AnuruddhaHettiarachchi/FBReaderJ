How to Build for Android
------------------------
For those who use Eclipse for Android development (most of you), jump to Part B

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part A.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:

1. Android SDK >= 1.6

2. Android NDK >= r4b

3. python

To build:

1. Create 'local.properties' file containing sdk.dir && ndk.dir definitions:
	sdk.dir=<path to the Android SDK folder>
	ndk.dir=<path to the Android NDK folder>
E.g., on my computer 'local.properties' consists of 2 lines:
  sdk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-sdk-mac_86
  ndk.dir=/Users/geometer/android-ndk-r4b

2. If you use Linux or MacOS, just run 'ant package' and go to step 3. For debugging 
purposes, you might want to run 'ant dbg' for building the package in debug mode, signing 
with your debug key (in this case, you can skip step 3).

If you are Windows user
  2a. Run ndk-build (a program from Android NDK directory) in your project catalog;
      This program only runs from Cygwin >= 1.7, please read NDK docs for details.
  2b. Run ./createRawResources.py script.
  2c. Run 'ant release'.

3. Sign your package manually.

Part B
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download the project code from git onto your local drive "git clone git://github.com/amahule/FBReaderJ.git".
2. Change the local.properties file to point to your Android SDK and NDK installations.
3. If you are running Linux or Mac OS, run "ant package" from inside the project directory containing build.xml 
   If you are running Windows, 
   - Run ndk-build (a program from Android NDK directory) in your project catalog;
      This program only runs from Cygwin >= 1.7, please read NDK docs for details.
   - Run ./createRawResources.py script.

   Make sure directories res/raw and res/drawable get created and are populated.
   These newly created resource directories are mandatory for creating an Eclipse project.
   Will still contain some compilation errors related to Bookshare classes.
4. Create a new Android project in Eclipse.
5. Choose create project from existing source. Point to the location of the downloaded code.
6. Put the Bookshare API access library on the build path (Present in downloads section on this project's github page)
   This step should remove all the errors mentioned in the step 3.
7. Build from within Eclipse
8. The signed apk will be present in the /bin folder which can be installed on the Android device/emulator.


Side Notes:
One common reason the build steps mentioned in Part A may fail is because 
the Android SDK and NDK locations in local.properties might not be correct.

Running the ndk-build enables compiles the native part of the code and creates shared object (.so) files.
Running the python script (createRawResources.py) creates the necessary directory structures of resources.

The Bookshare API library (Present in downloads section on this project's github page) should be included in the build path in the Eclipse project.
This shall remove the compilation errors and the apk file will be created after project is built in Eclipse.
