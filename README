This fork is an initiative for developing an e-book reader for daisy 3 files.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daisy 3 is a format that helps to make reading easier for those having reading disabilities.
Benetech (http://www.benetech.org/), the organization that leads the efforts for making the world 
a better place for the print disabled, is originator of this project.
Volunteer programmers help to develop and maintain this fork.

This is a fork of the FBReaderJ project located at https://github.com/geometer/FBReaderJ.
The original FBReaderJ project in under GNU GPL license.
As a result, this effort is also under the same license.

The apk file for this project can be downloaded from the Downloads section.
The Daisy 3 files can be searched for on the website - http://www.bookshare.org/ using advanced search.
The daisy 3 e-book needs to be pushed to the SD card into the folder set as the loading directory in
the settings of the FBReader app.
The book will automatically show in the Library section of the application.
A basic implementation of the Text-To-Speech functionality has been done using the Android TTS API. 
We will be working on a more sophisticated version of that module. 

This version also supports other formats namely epub, fb2, palmdoc and tcr.
